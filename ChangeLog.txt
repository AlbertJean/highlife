==================================================================

Sfz Parser was thoroughly redesigned and has the following new features:

* Sample path can be relative or absolute to any location on the storage media.
* Path names may contain blank spaces.
* <group> header can now be used.
* <key> opcode is now recognized.
* Comments can be put on the same line with opcodes.

As a side effect it should  be very easy now to include further sfz opcodes and headers.

Fixes and additions:

* The following additional zone parameters can now be modified from the zone editor panel: root key, low key, high key, low velocity, high velocity.
* A couple of wave files that were refused by the previous version will now load fine.
* Loopinfo will not be used if loopstart > loopend (workaround for some nonstandard wav editors)
* When creating loop crossfades Highlife now implements a equal power crossfade instead of the previously used equal gain (linear) crossfade.
* Highlife won't crash anymore whenever a sample can't be opened. Instead an error message is displayed and the load process is reverted.
* Added Open Source Logo.
* About box. (Click on the Highlife Logo to open)
